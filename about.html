Hi there! Welcome to The B Word!

A little bit about this blog...

The idea for this blog came about during the various lockdowns and as a result I had a LOT of free time.

I wanted to create something that included all of my favourite things, travel, beauty and skincare.

I will also be introducing a fitness section soon (what this space!)

I hope you enjoy this blog as much I did creating it!
